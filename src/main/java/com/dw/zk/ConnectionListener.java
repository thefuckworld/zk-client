     * in the ensemble. If, however, the client cannot connect to a ZooKeeper server within the specified session
     * timeout, then the ZooKeeper session is terminated by the ensemble, and the client transitions to the expired
     * state. Note, however, that the client is <em>not</em> guaranteed to receive notification of session expiration,
     * only of disconnection. It is therefore recommended that services which are subject to disconnection generally
     * cease operations, or at the very least pause operations, while a connection is re-established.
